           <p> The "Climate Change: Sea Level Rising Project" is a non-profit organization created by college students working to help residents and finding solutions. We address different issues that each city around the world is facing and offer ways to prevent tragedy. We study and research the causes with focus on the most effective way to overcome these obstacles, as we are also one of the many that is awaiting to witness a disaster, if we donâ€™t take action soon. </p><br>
           
           <p>As a group based in New York City, climate change, and specifically its impact on sea level, is an extremely pressing issue. The college we all currently attend is located close to a coastline and is majorly at risk. We are at risk of losing the places we love to visit and shop at. Overall, as New Yorkers, our livelihoods could be underwater in just a matter of years. And so, we found it hugely important to help raise awareness of this issue locally. </p><br>
           
           <p>Although our main audience are people who live in the state of New York, we are also concerned for the different people who live around coastlines in other countries. The percentage and ratings for the increase in water changes drastically depending on your location. In some towns and cities, sea levels are rising at a much faster pace. One example is the East coast and the Gulf of Mexico where there is one inch more water with every year that passes by, making them the areas with a faster pace. Unlike these areas, the west coast is slightly and visibly growing at a smaller and slower pace when it comes to the sea levels rising due to the tectonic plates shifting with time. </p><br>
           
           <p>With these difficult times, we should all come together as a team to overcome the problems and prevent the calamity that most will face in the future. Hopefully, we can help people become more aware and informed in order to save our Earth. </p>
