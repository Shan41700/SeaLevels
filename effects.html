               <h2>Local Effects</h2>
               
               <p>Since 1900, New York has experienced at least a foot of sea-level rise. Scientists believe that the sea levels will rise 18 to 50 inches higher by the year 2100. Some even believe that a rise as much as 75 inches could occur. Currently, more than half of New Yorkers live in areas that would be seriously affected.</p><br>
               
               <p>Lots of New York residents will have to relocate and most likely will be relocating into locations that will be in flooding areas in the near future. This is a problem for residents and businesses alike. Many businesses are already predicting double or quadruple their annual losses by the year 2050. New York’s infrastructure is also majorly at risk. Major highways, power plants, sewage treatment plants, tunnels, and other structures are in affected areas and cannot be moved out of them. Rising waters will also affect travel. Many parts of the MTA subway system will be rendered unusable and for air travel, “high tide” will cause more delays than usual. </p><br>

               <h2>Effects Elsewhere</h2>
               
               <p><b>Northern Europe:</b> Over the past couple of years there has been an increase of glaciers melting throughout greenland as well as the Antarctic. This not only affects the coastal lines and places that lie within the area, it also concerns the Europeans when it comes to sea such as the Blatic Sea, British Isles, and the North Sea. No to mention that with the water rising globally, there is also a rise in warmer temperatures which with time may mean no good to the people living.</p><br>
               
               <p><b>Gulf of Mexico:</b>Depending on the location for certain parts of the world, there are different effects that take place when it comes to the sea levels rising. Places such as areas near the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi, have been affected and will continue to be affected by sea levels.</p><br>
